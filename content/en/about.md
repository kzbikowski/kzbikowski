## About me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/~kzbikows/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

I am an assistant professor at the Institute of Computer Science of the Warsaw University of Technology and a Data Science Manager at mBank. I specialize in the application of machine learning methods in banking and cybersecurity. I like to use my data and process analysis knowledge to find simple solutions to (seemingly) complex problems.

I am a co-founder of [inhire.io](https://inhire.io) - a leading company operating in the field of IT recruitment in Poland.
